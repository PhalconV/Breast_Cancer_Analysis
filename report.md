### Executive Summary  
Evalyn Summary Suggestion:
Over the years, incident-related issues have risen significantly, leading to an increase in 911 calls. This has necessitated a shift in strategy, ensuring officers are dispatched only to incidents that cannot be resolved over the phone. To support this approach, this report analyzes over Nine Hundred and Fifty-Two Thousand, Eight Hundred and Thirty-Three (952833) 911 calls to enhance emergency response efficiency, assess the mental health impact of critical incidents, and evaluate the effectiveness of resource allocation.
Using Python and SQL, we identified key trends, assessed performance metrics, and highlighted critical safety concerns. The findings aim to optimize unit dispatch processes, prioritize resources effectively, and ensure timely responses to the most urgent situations.

This report analyzes over Nine Hundred and Fifty-Two Thousand, Eight Hundred and Thirty-Three (952833) 911 calls to improve emergency response times, assess the impact of critical incidents on mental health, and evaluate the effectiveness of resource allocation. By leveraging Python and SQL queries, we uncovered trends, evaluated performance metrics, and identified key safety issues.  
Key findings include:  
911 Call summation: Total 911 calls for the whole year (2021-2024) was observed to be 952, 828 with the highest call summation falling on to 2022.
Response Times: Average response time was 2,254 seconds for the whole year, with an increase as the year moves closer to 2024.  
Unit Time on Scene: Average unit time on scene was 6,090 for the whole year round.
Critical Incidents: Mental health-related calls increased by 12% compared to the previous year.  
Resource Allocation: Areas with frequent calls had uneven officer deployment, contributing to slower responses in high-density zones.  
Recommendations include optimizing resource distribution, focusing on mental health interventions, and refining call categorization processes to enhance officer and community safety.

Response Day of Week - The three-character day of week of the Response Datetime.

Response Hour - An integer representing the hour of day of the Response Datetime

First Unit Arrived Datetime - The date and time that the first APD unit arrived on scene to the incident. This is the endpoint for response time calculations. 

Call Closed Datetime - The date and time that the incident was closed, indicating that all units have left the scene and it is no longer active.

Sector - The Austin Police Department patrol sector where the incident occurred.

Initial Problem Description - A preliminary description of the problem meant to be addressed by the CAD incident based on either the information given to the 911 call taker in the case of dispatched incidents, or information collected by officers in the case of officer-initiated incidents.

Initial Problem Category- A general category describing the problem that the CAD incident was meant to address based on the Initial Problem Description value.

Census Block Group- Shortened Block Group Name based on the Census Bureau's Geo ID. 

Council District - The council district where the offense occurred.

II Data Cleaning Process
The data was cleaned using excel for easy access to the entire dataset. The process started with loading the data into excel power query editor. From here I checked for inconsistent data types starting with the date columns.
The date column was coded in datetime format formatted as text values. I handled this using the locale option in each column where I changed the data type to datetime and region to United States.
There are three datetime as Response Datetime, First Arrival Datetime, First Unit Arrival Datetime, Call Closed Datetime.
I created additional columns to get the Month, Day and Time (in hours) to identify trends and patterns. Following loading of the data into excel worksheet which has 952833 total rows, there were 4 errors waiting to be addressed. These errors are null records (rows with missing data) which triggered the alert. I treated this by removing the rows entirely. These rows are 952830, 952831, 952832, 952833. The total count of the dataset became 952829.

1. Handling Missing Values
Initial Check for Missing Values:
The dataset was assessed for missing values using the .isna().sum() method. This helped identify the columns with null entries and determine the scope of the issue.
Threshold-Based Removal of Rows with Null Values:
Rows with fewer than four non-null values were dropped using police_df.dropna(thresh=4, inplace=True). This ensured that rows with insufficient data were excluded, improving the dataset's reliability.
Filling Missing Values:
After removing incomplete rows, any remaining missing values were filled with 0 using police_df.fillna(0, inplace=True). This approach prevented null values from causing issues during analysis or computation.


2. Duplication
Identifying and Removing Duplicate Records:
The dataset was checked for duplicate rows using police_df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True). Duplicate entries can inflate the importance of certain data points or introduce bias. Removing them ensures accuracy and prevents redundancy in analysis.
Excel
Duplicate values are present in the Incident Number columns which could have stood as the primary key for each record. Upon closer inspections the records hold different incident values. There were differences between the records upon closer inspection or comparison. This was the reason for leaving the records without dropping duplicates.


3. Data Transformation
Datetime Formatting:
Columns containing datetime information were converted to a consistent and correct format using the pd.to_datetime() function:
Response Datetime
First Unit Arrived Datetime2
Call Closed Datetime
The format='mixed' parameter was used to handle inconsistencies in the input formats, and dayfirst=True ensured dates were interpreted correctly in a day-month-year format.
Effect of Transformation:
Standardizing the datetime format enabled efficient temporal analysis, such as calculating response times or understanding trends over specific timeframes.


4. Final Dataset Consistency Check
Verification of Missing Values:
After handling missing data and duplicates, the dataset was reassessed using police_df.isna().sum(). This ensured no null values remained, confirming the dataset's readiness for analysis.
Column Visibility:
The setting pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None) was used to display all columns when inspecting the dataset, ensuring comprehensive review and debugging.

Examples:
Call Trends: Mental health-related incidents are rising, requiring additional attention.  
Response Delays: High-density areas like downtown face longer response times due to inadequate officer coverage.  
Uneven Resource Allocation: Resource distribution does not correlate with call frequency, impacting response effectiveness.  
Rukayat: Between 1 pm and midnight, the frequency of 911 calls reaches the highest levels.
Toheeb
The Edward sector reported the highest number of crimes at 137,979, while the David sector accounted for the highest number of mental health-related incidents, totaling 19,068. Mental health incidents show significant daily variation, with the lowest numbers occurring on weekendsâ€”16,400 on Saturday and 16,298 on Sunday. In contrast, these incidents peak on weekdays, particularly on Monday (18,148), Wednesday (18,066), and Friday (18,282). Friday stands out as the day with the highest overall incidents reported.
Evalyn:
Mental health-related calls are significantly high (122,917 cases) which is 12.9% of total., while non-mental health-related calls dominate at 829,911 cases.
The number of incidents per day is steadily increasing from 2022 (211,731) to a projected 242,740 in 2024.



Recommendations  
Optimize Resource Allocation:  Deploy more officers in high-call-density areas, particularly during peak hours.  
Enhance Training Programs: Provide specialized training for mental health crisis intervention to improve response outcomes.  
Leverage Predictive Analytics: Use historical call data to predict and prepare for peak periods and high-priority incidents.  
Community Engagement: Raise awareness about mental health resources to reduce 911 dependency for non-urgent incidents. 
Toheeb
To ensure effective case management, proper and accurate record-keeping is essential. Key fields such as call disposition description, initial problem description, initial and final problem categories should be reviewed and refined to categorize related crimes more effectively.  
Additionally, data standardization must be prioritized during logging. For instance, incident numbers should be unique for each record to eliminate duplicates and maintain data integrity.
Evalyn:
Mental health-related incidents (e.g., "Unable to Locate" and "Report Written MH") account for a substantial portion of calls. Investing in specialized crisis intervention teams trained in mental health de-escalation can:
Improve case resolution.
Reduce repeat calls and ensure effective support for affected individuals.
Officers in low-performing units should receive additional training or technological upgrades (e.g., better communication tools or GPS tracking).
Units with high workloads may benefit from automation in report generation or AI-based dispatch systems to reduce administrative strain.
Integrating a real-time alert system can dynamically notify officers of demand surges, ensuring appropriate action.

Challenges and Limitations
Data Gaps: Missing values in response times required imputation, potentially introducing bias.  
Scope Limitations: Analysis focused on historical data without accounting for real-time operational variables (e.g., geo ID).  
Mental Health Tags: Limited accuracy in identifying mental health incidents due to inconsistent tagging.  
Gabriel: Data types were not clear despite having the data dictionary
Rukayat: Data types included inside the data dictionary were inconsistent and they had to be changed while writing the queries.
Evalyn: The GeoID provided does not correspond to a recognizable location on the map. As a result, it was not possible to generate a map or identify the specific areas where incidents occurred or where units were dispatched.
Toheeb
The dataset showed inconsistencies with the provided data dictionary. Notably, it contained only one incident type, which contradicted the variety expected based on the supporting document. Additionally, the call categories included values that could be consolidated, suggesting opportunities for data refinement and standardization.
Some questions in the dataset couldnâ€™t be answered for instance question three which have all the sectors mental health incidents percentages below 30%.
